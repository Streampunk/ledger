The following minor issues were found while working through the APIs:

* Comment in Flow.source_id says "Globally unique identifier for the _Flow_ which
  initially created the Flow". Should that be "Globally unique identifier for the
  _Source_ which initially created the Flow"?
* It is not clear what the Node.services property is for? Initially it seemed
  to be a link to all the devices in the node but looking at the examples, it
  appears to be something more internal to the BBC implementation?
